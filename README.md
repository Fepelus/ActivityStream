ACTIVITY STREAM
===============

Add, display and delete activities to do

This is the command-line tool I use for managing my to-do items.
I type `acts new 2014-01-01 12:00 Wash the car` and this activity
with its timestamp is added to the datafile. When I type `acts get`
(or, as I prefer, `watch acts get`) I will see a list of all
activities that have timestamps that are in the past. When I do
an activity I type `acts done id` with the id of the particular
activity and it no longer shows in the list.
